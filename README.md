This project is a derivative of the JGame Engine (http://www.13thmonkey.org/~boris/jgame/) by Boris van Schooten.

The aim of this derivative is to add a ROM reader to the engine. The game engine reads game definitions from a ROM. ROMS can be in any format ranging from SQLite databases to proprietary binary formats.

The advantage being that no code need be written to create new games.

This project is ultimately a stepping to stone to providing a Game Design UI that would generate ROMS. Thereby making it possible for non-programmers to create games.
